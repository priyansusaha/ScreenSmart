# ScreenSmart: AI-Driven Resume Parser and Scorer

ScreenSmart is an intelligent resume screening tool that combines the power of SpaCy's Named Entity Recognition (NER) with OpenAI's GPT to automate and enhance the candidate evaluation process. The system automatically extracts key information from resumes and provides job-specific scoring and detailed feedback.

  - Work experience and organizations
  - Dates and timeline
  - Contact information

- **Intelligent Scoring**: Leverage OpenAI's GPT for sophisticated resume evaluation
  - Job-specific scoring (0-100)
  - Detailed feedback on candidate strengths
  - Areas for improvement
  - Match analysis against job requirements


## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- SpaCy 3.0+
- PyPDF2
- OpenAI Python package
- Internet connection for GPT API access

## 💻 Usage

```python
from resume_parser import main

# Configure your inputs
pdf_path = "path/to/resume.pdf"
job_description = """
We are seeking a Python developer with strong experience in machine learning and NLP.
Required skills:
- Python programming
- Machine learning algorithms
- Natural Language Processing
- SQL databases
- Git version control
"""
openai_api_key = "your-api-key-here"

# Process the resume
result = main(pdf_path, job_description, openai_api_key)

# Print results
if result['success']:
    print(f"Extracted Entities:")
    for entity_type, entities in result['entities'].items():
        print(f"{entity_type.capitalize()}: {', '.join(entities)}")
    print(f"\nScore: {result['score']}/100")
    print(f"Feedback: {result['feedback']}")
else:
    print(f"Error: {result['error']}")
```

## 🔧 Configuration

The system can be configured through environment variables or direct parameters:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
- `SPACY_MODEL`: SpaCy model to use (default: "en_core_web_lg")
- `GPT_MODEL`: GPT model to use (default: "gpt-4")

## 📊 Sample Output

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "entities": {
        "skills": ["Python", "Machine Learning", "NLP", "SQL"],
        "organizations": ["Tech Corp", "AI Solutions Inc"],
        "dates": ["2020-2022", "2018-2020"],
        "emails": ["candidate@email.com"]
    },
    "score": 85.5,
    "feedback": "Strong technical background in required areas..."
}
```
