# ScreenSmart: AI-Driven Resume Parser and Scorer

ScreenSmart is an intelligent resume screening tool that combines the power of SpaCy's Named Entity Recognition (NER) with OpenAI's GPT to automate and enhance the candidate evaluation process. The system automatically extracts key information from resumes and provides job-specific scoring and detailed feedback.
